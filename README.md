The Linux4Max library brings a selection of linux audio plugins (mainly focused on dynamic processing and physical modeling) into the Max/MSP environment.
This collection of plugins derive from various developers, including the FAUST library, Fons Andriaensen's plugins, Robin Gareus' plugins (with multichannel support),K.S.Matheussen's radium compressor (with multichannel support),and Zam plugins collection.
The binaries are currently availabler for Windows only, but I have included the source code for those who wish to compile them for MacOS.
Contributions and corrections are welcome!
